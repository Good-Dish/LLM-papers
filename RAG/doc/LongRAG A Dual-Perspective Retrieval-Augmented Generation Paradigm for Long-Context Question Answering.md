# üñº Background & Problem Statement

## 1. **Long-Context Question Answering (LCQA)**

- When large language models (LLMs) process long contexts, they often focus on the beginning and end portions, **overlooking the middle** ‚Äî where critical information may reside.
- Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this to some extent, it faces its own inherent limitations.
- Long documents typically exhibit **low information density**, containing substantial noise relative to key facts.

## 2. **Limitations of Standard RAG**

- Splitting documents into chunks disrupts global coherence: each chunk represents only partial context.
- Consequently, LLMs may retrieve irrelevant content or fall back on their internal (parametric) knowledge instead of the source material.

## 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**

- CoT enables LLMs to explicitly reason through problems step by step, producing intermediate reasoning traces that can guide evidence retrieval.

### 1. Initial Stage

- Conventional RAG (divides documents into chunks, encodes them, and retrieves the top-k relevant chunks).

### 2. **Upper Line (CoT-Driven Filtering)**

- The model first generates a **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning path for the given question.
- Each reasoning step then filters the retrieved chunks, selecting those that provide **factual support** for the intermediate reasoning process.

### 3. **Lower Line (Semantic Restoration)**

- Retrieved chunks are restored and aggregated within the semantic space to recover **global information**.
- The LLM extracts essential content from these paragraphs as complementary evidence.

### 4. **Final Stage**

- The model synthesizes **factual details**, **global information**, and the **original question** to produce the final answer.

# üî¶ Personal Insights

## **Strengths**

- Offers a promising solution for **long-context reasoning**.
	- Integrating CoT helps decompose complex queries and constrains the model‚Äôs attention during evidence extraction.
	- Improves **explainability**, as intermediate chunks serve as interpretable reasoning evidence.
- This paradigm inspires potential extensions for multi-hop retrieval.

## **Limitations**

- **High computational cost** ‚Äî parallel processing requires deploying two LLM instances.
- **Longer inference time** ‚Äî if a single model handles the upper line, it must iteratively match each chunk, slowing computation.
- **Potential loss of reasoning diversity** ‚Äî relying on one CoT path may exclude alternative, equally valid reasoning trajectories.
