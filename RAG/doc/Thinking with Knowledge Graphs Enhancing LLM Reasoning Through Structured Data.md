# 🖼 Background & Key Problem

## 1. **KG-Augmented LLMs**

- Encoding knowledge graphs (KGs) as embeddings using graph neural networks (GNNs) enables semantic and structural representation learning, but often causes **representation misalignment** between GNN-encoded knowledge and LLM-generated embeddings.
- Querying KGs with **SPARQL** limits the LLM’s ability to perform complex reasoning, as the model does not participate in the retrieval process.
- Converting KGs into **natural language form** requires intricate algorithmic design to prevent **ambiguity** and preserve the **structured relationships** inherent in the graph.

# 🔌 Methodology & Innovation

## 1. **Representing KGs via Programming Language Syntax**

- The approach represents KGs directly through **programming language constructs**, preserving their complete structural form.
- LLMs can inherently **understand and reason** over programming syntax, removing the need for additional fine-tuning or adaptation to KG representations. Because programming syntax inherently encodes hierarchy, logic, and relations, it aligns well with how LLMs interpret structured text.
- This method allows LLMs to perform **more sophisticated reasoning** on structured data while maintaining relational integrity.

# 🔦 Personal Insights

## **Strengths**

- Representing structured knowledge through programming syntax offers a **novel perspective** on knowledge representation.
- It provides a potential optimization path for KG-augmented LLMs, enhancing their reasoning capability by leveraging structured, interpretable data formats.

## **Limitations**

- It remains challenging to **explicitly trace reasoning paths** during LLM interaction with KGs represented as code.
- The textualized structural information may lead to **hallucinated or illusory relationships**, reducing interpretability and reliability.
